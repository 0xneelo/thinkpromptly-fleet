# Fleetdeck v2 — improvisation log

Every shape or behaviour the mock leaves open, decided by a worker, gets one entry here: what was
decided, which ledger row or open item it serves, and why. An improvisation without an entry fails
review (operator rule, `plan.md` §"Improvisation rule"). Screenshots are required for visual
improvisations; data-only entries do not need them.

---

## L1 — data layer, fixture mode, v2 routing (Juergen, `agent-v2-l1`, 2026-09-07)

### I-L1-01 — The seed arrays are not data; adapters and the fixture carry the *data* layer only

**Serves:** the whole of L1 (`README.md` §Scope 1, §Acceptance rows 2 and 3), ledger rows D06/D18–D20.

The mock's seed arrays are local `const`s inside `AppLogic.renderVals()`
(`mock/Fleetdeck Final.dc.html` L1245–L2004). They are not JSON. Each element mixes three layers:

| Layer | Example | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · data | `regData[].s/g/tk/st`, `tiles[].name/box`, `keyRows[].fp` | **L1** |
| 2 · derived presentation | `dotStyle: dot(t.good)`, `provStyle: chipTone('neutral')`, `lines[].style`, `trendPts` | the compiled template (S2) |
| 3 · behaviour | `openTerm`, `toggle`, `show`, `copyConv` — arrows added by trailing `.map()` chains | the screen slices (L2–L10) |

**Decision: L1 emits layer 1 only** — precisely the fields named in `diff.md` §"Binding map" — and both
the adapters and `fixture.js` emit that same layer-1 projection.

**Why.** Layer 2 is computed from the theme token object `t`, which is rebuilt per render from
`state.dark`; dark and light produce different token values. If L1 baked style objects into its rows,
a row adapted while dark would render wrong in light and the pixel gate (which runs both themes)
could not pass. Layer 3 is functions — not serializable, and explicitly the screen slices' job.
`diff.md` §"Binding map" independently confirms the boundary: it lists only layer-1 fields, and for
the org chart it lists the *arguments* of `orgCard()` (`name, on, role, path, grp, epoch, lease, age,
exp`) rather than its returned keys (`name, role, path, grp, badge, dotStyle, badgeStyle, meta`).

**Consequence for S2 / L2–L10.** The compiled template keeps `dot()`, `chipTone()`, `bar()`, `mSec()`,
`spark()` and the token object `t`, and applies them at render time to whatever rows it is handed.
That is not new work: it is exactly what `renderVals()` already does today — the only change is that
the array it maps over comes from `FD.data` instead of a literal. L1 adds no rendering and does not
touch `index.html`, `logic.js`, `app.js` or `runtime.js`.

**Therefore "byte-equal to the mock's seed arrays"** (`README.md` §Acceptance) is read as *deep-equal
and key-order-equal over the layer-1 projection*. It cannot mean more than that: layers 2 and 3 are
theme-dependent and non-serializable, so no file on disk can be equal to them in any theme-independent
way. `test/v2-data.test.js` asserts that reading.

### I-L1-02 — `tools/extract-fixture.mjs` evaluates the mock in a sandbox; it never re-types it

**Serves:** `README.md` §Scope 1 ("extracted **verbatim** … by a script"), §Acceptance row 2.

The extractor slices each seed literal's *source text* out of the mock by bracket-matching from its
declaration, then evaluates it under `node:vm` in a context of stub helpers, then drops every key whose
value came back a sentinel or a function. No value is ever hand-transcribed, and a mock change flows
through on the next `npm run v2:fixture`.

The stubs are what make the layer split mechanical:

| Real helper | Stub returns | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `dot`, `chipTone`, and `t.*` (a Proxy) | a unique sentinel | the key is dropped — pure presentation |
| `bar(label, pct, resets, stale)` | `{label, pct, resets, stale}` | the layer-1 data *inside* the helper call survives |
| `mSec(env, name, email, chips, bars, note)` | one key per parameter | ditto |
| `orgMeta(...)`, `orgCard(...)` | one key per parameter | ditto — matches the binding map, which names the arguments |
| `spark(arr)` | `arr` | the raw 7-day numbers are data; the polyline string it builds is presentation |
| `this.state.adhoc` | `{}` → spread contributes nothing | keeps the fixture free of runtime state |

For the three `.map()`-chained arrays (`tiles` L1841–1870, `accounts` L1936–1964, `machines`
L1977–2001) the extractor takes the **raw array literal only**, stopping before `.map(` — which drops
layer 3 by construction.

Two drop rules beyond "the value is a sentinel or a function", both needed in practice:

- an object that had keys and lost all of them is dropped as well, so `lines[].style = {color: t.ink75}`
  disappears instead of leaving an empty `style: {}`;
- a key **named** `style` or `*Style` is dropped by name. This one is a convention, not a proof:
  `accounts[4].bannerStyle` is built by string concatenation with a theme token
  (`'1px solid ' + t.warn`), which yields a plain string that no sentinel test can catch. The mock's
  naming is consistent — every presentation key ends in `style`/`Style` and no data key does — but if a
  future mock breaks that convention the rule will silently keep a style string. Documented at
  `tools/extract-fixture.mjs:145`.

The tool fails loudly and names the declaration if a seed literal cannot be located **or if its anchor
is ambiguous** (`accounts:` and `machines:` each occur twice — the second time inside `titles`); a
silent partial extraction would be the worst outcome, because the mock is expected to change.
`npm run v2:fixture:check` fails when `public/v2/fixture.js` is stale, and it runs as part of
`pretest`, so `npm test` cannot pass against a stale fixture.

One consequence to hand on: `spark()` is stubbed to return its input, so `accounts[].trendPts` is a
number array in the fixture where the mock's runtime value is an SVG polyline string. The template
re-runs `spark()` on it — the same split as every other layer-2 value.

### I-L1-03 — `groups[]` keeps the mock's `items`, not the binding map's `sessions`

**Serves:** ledger D03, `diff.md` §"Binding map" row `groups[]`.

The binding map says `groups[]` has `box, n, sessions[]`. The mock actually declares
`{ box, n, items: [...] }` (L1817–1820). **The mock wins** — it is the pixel-gated ground truth and the
compiled template will read `items`; the binding map's `sessions[]` is a prose slip in the ledger.
`toGroups()` therefore emits `box, n, items`. Ledger correction for the design seat, not a build gap.

### I-L1-04 — Relative-time strings are formatted by the adapter

**Serves:** `diff.md` §"Binding map" rows `regData[]`, `dsData[]`, `orgCard()`.

The mock stores already-humanised strings — `regData[].active = '16h ago'`, `.msg/.seen = 'just now'`,
`dsData[].when = '1h ago'`, `.turns = '6 turns'`. The API returns machine timestamps
(`active_at`, `msg_at`, `last_seen_at`, `lastActivityAt`, all ISO strings or epoch numbers) and raw
counts (`completedTurns`). The adapters format to the mock's string shape so the type matches, using
one shared `ago()` helper. Formatting, not rendering: the value is a plain string either way, and the
template does no time maths today.

`created` is the exception — the mock keeps `dsData[].rows[].created` as a raw ISO string
(`'2026-09-06T13:49:10.097Z'`), so the adapter passes `createdAt` through unchanged.

### I-L1-05 — Fields the real API cannot supply are `null`

**Serves:** `README.md` §Scope "Out" ("If a shape needs data the API lacks, document it … and leave the
field `null`").

Checked against the live responses captured on 2026-09-07 in `fixtures/api/`.

| Mock field | Status | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `tiles[].foot1`, `.foot2`, `.lines` | footer copy is a registry-derived string, and `lines` is live xterm output | `null` / `[]`. `README.md` scopes `toTiles()` to name/box only; the footer is decided in **L3** (ledger D09, open item O2). |
| `busSessions[].pinned` | not in `/api/messages`; the binding map says "pinned/unread = client-side" | omitted by the adapter; a later slice (L6) adds it from local state. |
| `busSessions[].live` | `/api/messages` carries no liveness at all — only `source`, `target`, `status` and timestamps | `null` on every row. `toThreads()` takes messages alone, per the signature the pack fixes, so it cannot know. **L6 should join on `/api/sessions` by name** to fill it — the data exists there (`live`), just not on this endpoint. |
| `busSessions[].host` | present for `tmux` targets, absent for `claude-desktop` ones | the target's `host` when there is one, else `null`. |
| `busGroups[]` | the mock's one group is a hand-made ad-hoc group (`this.state.adhoc`); the API has no group concept | `[]` from live data. L6 owns ad-hoc groups. |
| `keyRows[].type` | the mock hard-codes ED25519 | **not** improvised — `/api/sshkeys` `.keys[].type` is real and is used. |
| `accounts[].trendPts` | open item **O6** says history does not exist server-side | it partly does: `credits.json` `.rows[].history` is present on 4 of 5 rows. The adapter passes `history` through as the raw number array when present and `null` otherwise. **Flagged for the design seat: O6 and the plan's new `L8s` server rider may be narrower than assumed.** L1 does not act on this beyond passing the data through. |
| `sessions[].reaped_at`, `.pinger_dead` | present in the schema, `null` on all 114 captured rows | passed through; nothing in the mock binds them. |
| `messages[].error` | `null` on all 50 captured rows | passed through — it is the source for a failed message's `err`, and the capture simply had no failures. |
| `health.alerts[].host` | `null` on all 10 captured rows | passed through. |
| `desktop-sessions … .worktree` | `null` on all 923 captured rows | passed through; the mock binds `path` from `cwd`. |

### I-L1-06 — `receipts` derive from the message `status`, per-recipient only for broadcasts

**Serves:** ledger D13, `diff.md` §"Binding map" row `busSessions[]`/`seedThreads`.

The mock's thread messages carry `status` (one of `queued | delivered | acked | failed | offline`) on
**outbound** messages only; inbound messages have no `status` key, and a broadcast carries `per`
(a map of member id → status) *instead of* `status` (L1429–L1446). `/api/messages` returns a flat
`status` on every row plus `target`, `error`, `created_at`, `delivered_at`.

`toThreads()` reproduces that split exactly: direction from whether `source` or `target` names the
session; `status` copied through on outbound only; `err` set from `error` when `status === 'failed'`;
`per` built only when a row's `target` addresses more than one recipient. Inbound rows get no `status`
key at all — an absent key, not `null`, because the mock distinguishes the two and the template's
`sc-if` bindings test presence.

### I-L1-07 — `tk` is filled from the registry `task` field

**Serves:** `diff.md` §"Binding map" row `regData[]`.

The binding map maps `regData[].tk` to registry `task`, and `/api/sessions` rows carry `task`
(present on all 114 captured rows). No ambiguity in practice — recorded because `README.md` names it
as an open shape decision. The mock's sample values (`'O44-84'`) are Linear-style issue keys, which is
what `task` holds.

### I-L1-08 — `fd-landing-dark` stores a `'1'`/`'0'` dark flag

**Serves:** ledger D06 (theme key migration).

The new key is named for a *dark* boolean, so it stores `'1'` / `'0'`, not `'light'` / `'dark'`.
Migration reads `fd-landing-dark` first; when absent it falls back to the legacy `fleetTheme` and maps
`'light'` → `'0'` and anything else → `'1'`. That "anything else is dark" rule is today's behaviour,
not a new one: `public/sessions.js:32` already tests only for `'light'`. The resolved value is written
back to `fd-landing-dark`; the legacy key is left in place so the old UI keeps working until the L11
cut-over deletes it.

### I-L1-09 — the `/v2/` fix is a general directory-index rule

**Serves:** `README.md` §Scope 2, §Acceptance row 4.

`server.js` had exactly one index fallback, the literal root check `p === '/' ? 'index.html' : …`, so
every other directory URL reached `fs.readFile` on a directory, got `EISDIR`, and was mapped to 404.
The fix adds one ternary arm rather than a `/v2`-special case:

```js
const rel = p === '/' ? 'index.html'
  : p.endsWith('/') ? p.replace(/^\/+/, '') + 'index.html'
  : p.replace(/^\/+/, '');
```

It is smaller than a path-specific branch and matches the surrounding style. It applies to any
trailing-slash URL under `public/`, but changes behaviour only where an `index.html` actually exists —
every other directory URL still 404s, just one `readFile` later. The traversal guard below it is
untouched and still rejects anything escaping `public/`.

### I-L1-13 — the desktop-row fallbacks are the current app's words

**Serves:** ledger D17; design ruling 2026-09-07.

`/api/desktop-sessions` leaves fields empty often enough that the fallback wording is part of the
shape, not an edge case: on the 923 captured rows `branch` is null 313 times and `completedTurns` is
null 43 times. The adapter uses the current app's exact strings, so the two UIs never disagree:

| Field | Null becomes | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `branch` | `'No branch'` | `public/sessions.js:225` |
| `model` | `'Model unknown'` | `public/sessions.js:225` |
| `turns` | `'Turns unknown'` | `public/sessions.js:229` |

The turn count matters most: it previously rendered `'0 turns'`, which asserts something the API never
said — a session whose count is unknown is not a session with no turns. A reported `0` still renders
`'0 turns'`. `sessions.js:229` tests `=== null`; the adapter folds in `undefined` too, since a missing
key can only mean the same thing (the API always sends the key, so this is not observable today).

### I-L1-12 — human labels the API does not carry, and fixture mode is read-only

**Serves:** ledger D15, D16; found by the reviewer pass on the adapters.

Four label decisions and one safety rule, all from comparing adapter output against the mock
row by row rather than against its key list.

| Field | API gives | Mock shows | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| `accounts[].plan`, `machines[]…chips[1]` | `tier: 'default_claude_max_20x'` | `'Max 20×'` | derived: `/max[_-]?(\d+)x$/` → `'Max N×'`. The API has no human tier name, and passing the raw enum puts `claude_max` on screen. |
| `machines[]…chips[0]` | `plan: 'claude_max'` | the plan family **and** the tier, as two chips | both are emitted; the mock always carries the pair for a tiered account. |
| `accounts[].id` | the full org uuid | first 8 hex (`'c578669c'`) | sliced, matching what `toDesktop()` already does for the account uuid. |
| `accounts[].banner` | `state: 'error'` | a sentence, `'could not read usage on rfc1918-internal'` | the server's own `errors[]` message when one names the row, otherwise that sentence. The raw enum must never reach the screen. |

**`machines[].cols` groups by client, it does not map 1:1.** A machine can report the same client
twice — german-box runs a WSL side and a Windows side, and `/api/machines` returns eight client rows
for it. The mock puts those in **four** columns of **two** sections (`fixture.machines[1]`), with
`env` labelling the environment. A 1:1 map produced eight single-section columns: the right key set,
the wrong structure, and the shape tests did not catch it because they only walked `Array.isArray`.
`env` is `''` on a single-environment machine and `WSL` / `Windows` where there are two.

**`machines[]…bars` tuples are two elements, not three.** The mock writes `[label, pct]` and only
grows a third element when the window is stale. The adapter now matches; a fixed-width triple was a
silent shape mismatch.

**Fixture mode is read-only.** `?fixture=1` originally intercepted only the ten reading endpoints, so
`kill`, `registryDelete`, `deleteKey`, `mintCert`, `sendMessage`, `retryMessage`, `registryUpsert`,
`startTrain` and `endTrain` still reached the network. A Kill clicked on a page in fixture mode would
have destroyed a real session. All nine now resolve `{ok: true, fixture: true}` and touch nothing;
a test asserts both that they are inert in fixture mode and that they still work outside it.

### I-L1-11 — `trendPct` is derived, and empty history is `null` rather than `''`

**Serves:** ledger D15, open item **O6**, `diff.md` §"Binding map" row `accounts[]`.

Two small divergences in `accounts[]`, both deliberate.

**`trendPct` is not adapted.** The mock's five accounts do not share one key set: row 0 carries the
base set, rows 1–4 add `trendPct`, rows 2–4 add `staleNote`, row 4 adds `banner`. `trendPct` is a
percentage computed *from* `trendPts` — the same derivation that produces the sparkline polyline and
`trendColor`, both of which are layer 2 and were dropped at extraction. Emitting it from L1 would mean
guessing the mock's formula, and a wrong guess shows up as a wrong number on screen. The adapter
therefore emits the base key set plus `staleNote` / `banner` where they apply, and the template
computes `trendPct` from the `trendPts` array it already receives — exactly as it computes the
polyline. Consistent with I-L1-01.

**Empty history is `null`, not `''`.** The mock's own "no history" sentinel is the empty string
(`accounts[0].trendPts === ''`); the pack's convention for data the API cannot supply is `null`. The
adapter uses `null`. Both are falsy, so the template's `showTrend` test behaves identically; the type
differs only in the empty case.

**`trendPts` is a `number[]`, not the raw history rows** (design ruling 2026-09-07). `/api/credits`
returns `history[]` as `{t, fh, sd, xu}` samples; `sd` is the sampled seven-day percentage and is the
series the sparkline draws. The adapter emits `history.map(h => h.sd)` sorted by `t`, dropping samples
with no reading, so the value is a clean array of numbers the template hands straight to `spark()`.
The raw objects never reach the seed. Sorting rather than trusting the server's order is defensive —
the captured rows are already ordered, and staying ordered is what makes the line meaningful.

Worth the design seat's attention: **O6 is narrower than it looks.** The ledger says "trend history
does not exist server-side", but `/api/credits` returns a `history[]` of `{t, fh, sd, xu}` samples on
4 of the 5 captured rows. The sparkline may need no server rider at all, or a much smaller one than
the planned `L8s` slice assumes. L1 passes the history straight through and does nothing further.

### I-L1-10 — the v2 URL scheme follows the pack, not the plan's decision 3

**Serves:** `README.md` §Scope 2, ledger D20.

`plan.md` decision 3 rules "Landing on `/`, App on `/app`". `README.md` §Scope 2 instead specifies
`?view=land|app|deck` plus `#screen` hashes, defaulting to `app` inside `/v2/`, and puts the cut-over
and legacy redirects in **L11**. L1 implements the pack: the two are not in conflict, they are
different phases — `?view=` is how the shell selects a view while v2 lives beside the old UI at
`/v2/`, and L11 maps the final `/` and `/app` routes onto it. Recorded so L11 does not read the query
scheme as a contradiction of the ruling.

## L8 — Accounts (credits) cards (Kunhild, `agent-v2-l8`, 2026-09-07)

Ledger row D15. The mock is the look, `docs/goals/fd-v2-l8/BEHAVIOUR.md` is the behaviour. Every entry
below is a place where today's Accounts page says something the mock's markup has no slot for. Fixture
mode (`?fixture=1`) is untouched by all of it — `screens/accounts.js` returns before doing anything
when `FD.data.isFixture()`, and the pixel gate reads `accounts` at **0.000000 %**.

### I-L8-01 — The summary bar is static text in the mock, so the live one is a block the screen owns

**Serves:** `BEHAVIOUR.md` §2, `README.md` §Scope 1. **Screenshot:** `improvised/l8-summary-bar.png`.

The mock's summary row is four literal spans — `5` `accounts`, `0` `at or over a limit`,
`no credits spent`, and a shortened privacy note (template L569-574, compiled to `app.js` text nodes
`k|1293`, `k|1298`, `k|1302`, `k|1305`). They are text, not bindings, and the runtime rewrites a text
node whenever its string differs, so the counts **cannot** be driven from `renderVals` — only a
template change could bind them, and the template is not this slice's file.

L8 therefore hides the four static spans and paints live ones. Two constraints shaped how:

- No foreign DOM inside a compiled node (DESIGN-35 binding, 2026-09-08). So the block is a single
  container this file owns, `#fd-l8-chrome`, appended to `document.body` **outside `#dc-root`**, and
  positioned on the mock's own summary row via its bounding rect (re-placed on scroll, resize and any
  mutation, coalesced to one animation frame).
- The row must keep its box, or the overlay has nothing to land on. The static spans are hidden with
  `visibility`, not `display`.

Two style properties are written onto compiled nodes — `visibility` on the four spans, and `minHeight`
on the row, because the real privacy note is four lines where the mock's shortened one is one, and the
cards have to start below it. Neither property appears in the styles the template binds on those
nodes, and `setProp` only writes the properties present in the new style object, so neither write is
undone by a re-render or by a theme change. **A style write is not a mounted child**: nothing of L8's
is ever a descendant of a compiled node, which `verify/l8/live.json` B32b asserts.

The privacy note is the full sidebar text from `accounts.html:13-18`, verbatim, including the
`credits-accounts.json` sentence the mock's shortened version drops.

### I-L8-02 — Rows that have something wrong with them open by themselves

**Serves:** `README.md` §5 ("default expanded state … pick one"). **Screenshot:**
`improvised/l8-default-expanded.png`.

Today's page has no collapse: every card is always open. The mock's cards are collapsible and start
closed, showing one bar. Closed is the mock's look and the pixel gate depends on it, so fixture mode
keeps it exactly.

On live data a row opens by itself when it is **at or over a limit**, or carries a **banner**, or has
**no data**, or reported **no usage windows** — the four cases where a collapsed card would hide the
only thing worth reading. Everything else starts collapsed, as the mock has it. A click still toggles
any row, and an explicit toggle always wins over the default.

### I-L8-03 — Five note lines become one, with the mock's separator

**Serves:** `BEHAVIOUR.md` §3. **Screenshot:** `improvised/l8-note-line.png`.

Today's card can show five separate lines the mock's card has no slot for: the sampled note, the
credits line, `no data yet — run push from their machine`, `no usage windows reported`,
`no history yet`, plus the header's `unconfirmed mapping`. The mock's card has exactly **one** free
text line (the stale note, template L590-592).

L8 joins them into that one line with the mock's own `·` separator, each sentence verbatim, in the
order today's page prints them. The line's colour is the strongest tone present — red past three days
stale, amber for a one-to-three-day sample, an unconfirmed mapping or a capped credit pool, muted
otherwise — restored by a `color` write on that `<p>` for the same reason as I-L8-01.

The alternative, one appended node per line, is exactly what the DESIGN-35 binding forbids: a card is
an `sc-for` row with a positional identity, and the runtime deletes foreign children whenever it
reconciles one, so those lines would be deleted and re-inserted on every open and close.

### I-L8-04 — Collector errors and Refresh, in the same owned block

**Serves:** `BEHAVIOUR.md` §4. **Screenshot:** `improvised/l8-errors-refresh.png`.

The mock's Accounts screen has neither an errors panel nor a Refresh control (its one Refresh button
belongs to the shell header, which is L2's file, and is unbound). Both are improvised into the block
from I-L8-01, in the mock's panel and pill-button tokens: `Collector errors` over one
`<host>: <message>` line per error, then Refresh. `cannot reach fleetdeck` appears beside the button
when the fetch fails.

Not pinned to the bottom-right of the window: the mock keeps its own `← fleetdeck` button fixed there
at `z-index: 9999`.

### I-L8-05 — The trend keeps the mock's box: a stroke, no area, no tooltip

**Serves:** `BEHAVIOUR.md` §3 (Trend), ledger O6. **Screenshot:** `improvised/l8-trend.png`.

Today's sparkline is a `0 0 100 28` svg with a filled polygon under a polyline and a `<title>` reading
`N days, M samples`. The mock's is a `0 0 100 24` svg with **one** polyline and no title, and the
template is not this slice's file. So the points are scaled into the mock's 24-high box, the area fill
is dropped, and the tooltip is dropped with it — a `<title>` would be a foreign child of a compiled
node (I-L8-01).

What is preserved: the x axis is time-scaled from `history[].t` so gaps in sampling read as gaps (with
the same divide-by-zero fallback as `accounts.js:100-104`), `sd` is clamped to 0-100, fewer than two
numeric samples means no line at all (and a `no history yet` note instead, I-L8-03), the right-hand
label is the last sample's `sd`, and the stroke colour is that sample's level. Codex rows have no
history and get no trend block at all.

O6 ("trend history does not exist server-side") is superseded, as L1 found: `/api/credits` returns
`history[]` on four of the five captured rows and L8 plots it. L8 reads `history[]` from the response
directly rather than `toAccounts().trendPts`, because the x axis needs each sample's timestamp.

### I-L8-06 — The bars gain the red step the mock's helper does not have

**Serves:** `BEHAVIOUR.md` §3 (Bars). **Screenshot:** `improvised/l8-default-expanded.png` (the
`7 day Fable` bar at 100 % against `5 hour` at 29 %).

Today's page tints a bar red over 90 % and amber from 70 % (`accounts.js:57`). The mock's shared
`bar()` helper stops at amber. `bar()` is also the Machines screen's helper, so L8 does not change it:
it builds its own bar objects in its own `logic.js` block, with the mock's shape and the extra step.
Only the fill carries the level colour — the percentage text stays the mock's neutral ink, as today's
`.pct` rule does.

### I-L8-07 — One plan pill where today's page can show two

**Serves:** `BEHAVIOUR.md` §3 (Header). Not separately screenshotted; visible in every card.

Today's header appends a tier pill *and*, for a codex row, a plan pill. The mock's header has one plan
slot. When a row carries both (no captured row does — the codex row has no tier), L8 renders them as
one pill, `<tier> <plan>`. A second pill would be a foreign child of a compiled node.

### I-L8-08 — The screen loads `data.js` itself, because the shell does not

**Serves:** `README.md` §Cross-slice contract. Not a visual improvisation; recorded because it affects
every L-slice.

`public/v2/index.html` loads `runtime.js`, `fixture.js`, `logic.js`, `app.js` and the nine screen
files — but **not** `public/v2/data.js` or `router.js`. So `FD.data` is undefined on a plain page
load, and a screen that calls `FD.data.credits()` silently does nothing. `index.html` is S2's file and
no slice may edit it, so `screens/accounts.js` appends its own `<script id="fd-data-js" src="/v2/data.js">`
when `FD.data` is missing. The id is shared, so nine slices asking for it still load the file once.

This is a shell gap, not an L8 decision, and it is filed for the design seat as DECK-87 — the fix
belongs in `index.html`, and once it lands the loader here becomes dead code and should be removed.
